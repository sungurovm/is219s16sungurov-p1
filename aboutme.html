		<h1>Education</h1>
New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ
<p>Summary: I am a person with many unique qualities about me. For one I am a fast learner and have always strived to further my academic success. I have grown from autistic special education student in my youth, to honors high school graduate and dean’s list honor roll in college. Not many can say they have overcome as many obstacles as I have in my past. The one thing that keeps me pushing forward is the exhilarating feeling I know my wealth of knowledge has been growing and accumulating further throughout the years. My ability to learn quickly has helped me in my academic success and throughout my life. My university GPA has been steadily increasing every semester since I started.</p>
